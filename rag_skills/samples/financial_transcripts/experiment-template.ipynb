First Quarter Earnings Conference Call  Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood  Tuesday, October 25, 2022  BRETT IVERSEN:  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are  Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief  financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver,  deputy general counsel.  On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings  press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to  supplement our prepared remarks during today\\'s call and provides the  reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial  measures.  On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial  measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior  to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with  GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in  further understanding the company\\'s first quarter performance in addition  to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.  All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the  corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also  provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework  for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the  effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the  same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.  We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following  the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\\'s call is being  webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our  live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.  You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor  Relations website.  During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are  predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These  statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are  subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ  because of factors discussed in today\\'s earnings press release, in the  comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of  our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to  update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Satya.  SATYA NADELLA:  Thank you, Brett.  To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these  changing economic times:  First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular  trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world\\'s GDP will  continue to increase.  Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of  their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.  And, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.  With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25  billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant  currency.  And, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader  commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this  fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our  consumer business.  With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.  Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less  today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk  around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.  We\\'re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with  infrastructure they already have.  With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services -  including containerized applications - across on-premises, edge, and multi-  cloud environments.  We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the  number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers\\' SAP  workloads in the cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo  Cars all run SAP on Azure.  We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle  databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for  companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both  companies.  And, with Azure Confidential Computing, we\\'re enabling companies in  highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive  applications to the cloud.  Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its  applications to Azure.  Now, to data and AI.  With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data  fabric, helping customers cut \"integration tax\" associated with bringing  together siloed solutions.  Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to  process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to  database powering the world\\'s most-demanding workloads, at limitless  scale.  Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud  provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and  NoSQL workloads.  And, in Al, we are turning the world\\'s most advanced models into platforms  for customers.  Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E to Azure OpenAI service,  helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation  model to commercial use cases for the first time.  And Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping  organizations like 3M deploy, manage, and govern models.  All-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four  quarters in a row.  Now, on to developers.  We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native  applications.  Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual  recurring revenue. And GitHub\\'s developer-first ethos has never been  stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software  for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times.  GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security  posture by bringing features directly into developers\\' workflows.  Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers  build and secure many of its most critical applications.  Now, on to Power Platform.  We\\'re helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite,  spanning low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual  agents, and business intelligence.  Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is  growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on  the tool for reporting and analytics.  Power Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly  15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a  year ago.  Power Automate has over 7 million monthly active users, and is being used  by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize  manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time.  And we\\'re going further, with new Al-powered capabilities in Power  Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.  Now, on to Dynamics 365.  From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we  continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example,  Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related  shipments.  CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost  efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency  and spend at its restaurants. And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and  improving supply chain visibility.  All-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business  applications.  Now, on to industry solutions.  We\\'re seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds.  Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new  digital ex', '@search.score': 0.8299851, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

to deliver new  digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track  their environmental footprint.  New updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon  emissions.  And we're seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance  DAX ambient intelligence solution, which automatically documents patient  encounters at the point of care.  Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's  quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings.  Now, on to new systems of work.  Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in  today's digitally connected, distributed world of work.  Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people  work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT.  The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with  third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations.  Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become  essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate,  and do business.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we've gained and  are seeing increased engagement too.  Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.  In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams  chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more  features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year.  Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process.  Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications  within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year.  And, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today  also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.  Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by  double-digits for five quarters in a row.  We're bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including  Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively.  And we're creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help  organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person  work.  Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and  collaborate, Places will do the same for where.  We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for  advanced meeting features, like additional security options and intelligent  meeting recaps.  All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.  Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank,  continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security,  compliance, voice, and analytics.  We've also built a completely new suite with our employee experience  platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly  active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever.  And, we're extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping  salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time  by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into  their CRM system.  Now, on to Windows.  Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues  to see usage growth.  All-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active Windows devices  than pre-pandemic.  And, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5  percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.  And, we're seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11.  Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000  employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L'Oreal has  deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.  Now, on to security.  Security continues to be a top priority for every organization.  We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning  security, compliance, identity, and device management, and privacy across  all clouds and platforms.  More than 860,000 organizations across every industry - from BP and  Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies - now use our  security solutions, up 33 percent year over year.  They can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security  stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have  increased 50 percent year over year.  More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to  secure their entire digital estate.  The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44  percent year over year.  And as threats become more sophisticated, we're innovating to protect  customers.  New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and  manage security posture across clouds.  And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-  premises and cloud-based user directories.  Now, on to LinkedIn.  We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million  members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in  the Unites States.  There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on  LinkedIn, up 4X year over year.  New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning help companies  invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in  the flow of work.  Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months,  up 43 percent year over year.  And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn  professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform.  We launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping  sellers increase win rates and deal size by better understanding and  evaluating customer interest.  Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading  innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.  More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for  any marketer or advertiser looking to innovate.  We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X over the past year.  We're seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by  Windows.  Edge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain  share as people use built-in coupon and price comparison features to save  money.  We've surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we  brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets.  Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more  content, compared to a year ago.  And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory.  Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month,  exclusively powered by our technology and sales.  And, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel media platform for retailers  like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining  ownership of their own data and customer relationships.  Now, on to gaming.  We're adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition  to reach players wherever and whenever they want, on any device.  We saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by strength off-console.  PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year. And with  Cloud Gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played, and  viewed.  More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to  date.  And we're adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech  and Razer, as well as Meta Quest.  And, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming,  with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S.  Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.  In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the  ultimate tailwind.  And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every  organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence  and execution discipline.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.  AMY HOOD:  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone.

number that you're referring to, we had good what we would call long dated growth, which means we're  having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the  platform.  And that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest  here remain intact. And so, it's about both the optimization that you're  talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also  includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up,  one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some  volatility.  The other piece of it, Mark, that we didn't talk on before because I was  really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well,  right, because we're getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in  terms of the per-seat business.  So, there's a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a  very large base. It's not just the optimization to new workloads. It's also  some per-user work as well.  MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, last quarter you called out for the first time  SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning,  did that get worse this quarter? And did you see it filter now into the  enterprise? Can you talk about what you're seeing higher up above SMB?  AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about  Microsoft 365. I think that's a place where we can talk specifically about the  SMB market, because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it  was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4.  In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it  speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft. 365. We had on-  time renewals that were, frankly, better in Q1, based on expirations, than  we'd seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting  done on time but getting done within a discount range that we feel good  about, that's consistent. And we saw good upsell to E5. So if you think  about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB,  that's a good summary.  Where we in fact saw - I think we talked about it - new deal moderation, I'd  referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well, it tended to be in, to your point, the  smaller end of the market, small-to-midsize companies, and it also tended  to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit  and I'd refer to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some  new value that we've put into E3.  This is a place where there is some macro impact, but there's also, I think, a  better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition.  We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto  patching for Windows. It's a great value in the same way E5 is. We land the  E5 really well. We've got some work to do on landing E3.  So, there is some macro. It seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than  inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that I think,  frankly, we can get better at as well.  BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, Thank you very much. Satya, this  quarter, we're seeing an inflection in many of your Al breakthroughs. I'm  thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer  product. What is it that's enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially  to be first to market? I'm wondering if it's the OpenAl relationship or  maybe some of your inferencing capabilities, or something else.  And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in  Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of  dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like 200 million per  quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that  through this period?  SATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI  partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it's sort of important  to call out that we build the supercomputing capability inside of Azure,  which is highly differentiated the way compute and the network, in  particular, come along, come together in order to support these largescale  training of these platform models or foundation models has been very  critical. That's what's driven, in fact, the progress OpenAl has been making.  And of course, we then productize it as part of Azure OpenAI Services. And  that's what we're seeing both be used by our own first-party applications,  whether it's the GitHub Copilot or designer even inside Edge, and then of  course the third party, like Mattel.  And so, we're very excited about it. We have a lot, sort of more to talk  about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances  on GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area  of huge investment. The Al moment clearly has arrived and it's going to be  part of every product, whether it's - in fact, you mentioned our Power  Platform, because that's another area where we're innovating in terms of  incorporating all of these AI models.  Yeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability  at an infrastructure layer for training and inference. And the model  themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party applications  are getting better because of the use of those AI models.  AMY HOOD: And to your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a  little bit of help there. We did not see as big of that. As I said, it's over 800  for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2  through 4. And I think if you want to think about it as somewhere, 250-ish a  quarter. It's not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the  remainder of the year.  MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, I've love to just ask you around  margins. Clearly, you're experiencing a little bit more sales mix, given the  weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you've elected not to throttle  back OpEx to enable you to meet the three-months-ago guidance for flat  margins, so they'll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through  that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows  pressure?  AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl, and I shared a little bit on the call, but let me  share a little more because I think it's important in terms of how we think  about investment and continuing to invest where we're seeing substantial  opportunity and growth.  The PC market is cyclical, and we had some great benefits for a couple of  years during the pandemic. And we chose not to spend against that  favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line. And  you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did  that intentionally because it is a cyclical market.  And so, in the same way I see it now, is that PCs are going to be a tough  headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows app install base, our  ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good  opportunity for us. And so, in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom  line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down  market, because when you have a type of opportunity that we have  specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked  about as being some of our most exciting, and you have the opportunity  with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it's  important to have a steady hand.  Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the  macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential  headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It'll be about investing \", '@search.score': 0.8231681, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

'MSFTTranscriptFY23Q1.pdf, P.25, line 16', 'Filter': 'MSFTFY23Q1', 'Id': '16', 'Chunk': 'd afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11 percent and 16 percent in constant currency.  Earnings per share was $2.35 - and increased 4 percent and 11 percent in  constant currency, when adjusted for the net tax benefit from the first  quarter of fiscal year 22.  Driven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid  start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations, even as we saw many  of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken  thru Q1.  In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in  September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses.  And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in  the quarter, impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing  Solutions.  As you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall  demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, with growth of 31 percent in  constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses.  Commercial bookings declined 3 percent and increased-16 percent in  constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth  was driven by strong renewal execution and we continued to see growth in  the number of large, long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across  all deal sizes. More than half of the 10-million-dollar-plus Microsoft 365  bookings came from E5.  Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31 percent and 34  percent in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be  recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23 percent year-over-year.  The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12  months, increased 38 percent year-over-year. And our annuity mix  increased 1 point year-over-year to 96 percent.  FX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger  US dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points. And at a  segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes and  Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 6 points, and More Personal  Computing revenue growth by 3 points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS  and operating expense growth by 3 points.  Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-  over-year to 73 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting  estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage  decreased roughly 1 point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower  Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs.  Company gross margin dollars increased 9 percent and 16 percent in  constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-  over-year to 69 percent. Excluding the impact of the latest change in  accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points  driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier, and  Nuance.  Operating expense increased 15 percent and 18 percent in constant  currency driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and  commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22 percent  year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas just mentioned, as  well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points  from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4,  respectively.  Operating income increased 6 percent and 15 percent in constant currency.  And operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43  percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate,  operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales  mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance, and the lower Azure  margin noted earlier.  Now to our segment results.  Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.5 billion and  grew 9 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations  with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn.  Office commercial revenue grew 7 percent and 13 percent in constant  currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11 percent and 17  percent in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong  renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by installed base  expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher  ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance, and voice value in  Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office  365 commercial seats grew 14 percent year-over-year, driven by our small  and medium business and frontline worker offerings - although we saw  continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5.  Office consumer revenue grew 7 percent and 11 percent in constant  currency driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions,  which grew 13 percent to 61.3 million.  Dynamics revenue grew 15 percent and 22 percent in constant currency  driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24 percent and 32 percent in constant  currency.  LinkedIn revenue increased 17 percent and 21 percent in constant currency,  ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent  Solutions partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the  advertising trends noted earlier.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 11 percent and 18 percent in  constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point  year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting  estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix  shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13 percent and 16  percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 10 percent  and 19 percent in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest  change in accounting estimate.  Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing  20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations.  Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22 percent  and 28 percent in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services  revenue grew 35 percent and 42 percent in constant currency, about a  point lower than expected - driven by the continued moderation in Azure  consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads  while they prioritize new workloads.  In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base  grew 18 percent to over 232 million seats with continued impact from the  new deal moderation noted earlier.  In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat and increased 4  percent in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations - driven by  hybrid demand including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead  of the SQL Server 2022 launch.  Enterprise Services revenue grew 5 percent and 10 percent in constant  currency, driven by Enterprise Support Services.  Segment gross margin dollars increased 20 percent and 26 percent in  constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly.  Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross  margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to  Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating  expenses increased 25 percent and 28 percent in constant currency,  including roughly 8 points of impact from Nuance, and operating income  grew 17 percent and 25 percent in constant currency, with roughly 9 points  of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate.  Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-  year to $13.3 billion, and grew 3 percent in constant currency, in line with  expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside  in Gaming consoles.  Windows OEM revenue decreased 15 percent year-over-year. Excluding the  impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20 percent  driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier.  Devices revenue grew 2 percent and 8 percent in constant currency, in line  with expectations, driven by the impact of a large Hololens deal, partially  offset by', '@search.score': 0.82198936, '@search.reranker_score': None, '@search.highlights': None, '@search.captions': None}\n",

'Filter': 'MSFTFY23Q1', 'Id': '17', 'Chunk': 'arge Hololens deal, partially  offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8 percent  and 15 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by  demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier.  Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC, increased 16 percent and 21  percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefitting from an  increase in search volumes and roughly 5 points of impact from Xandr even  as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser  gained share again this quarter.  And in Gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4 percent in constant  currency, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected console  sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13 percent and 19 percent in constant  currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3 percent and  increased 1 percent in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party  content as well as in third-party content, where we had lower engagement  hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game  Pass subscriptions.  Segment gross margin dollars declined 9 percent and 4 percent in constant  currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 5 points year-  over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating  expenses increased 2 percent and 5 percent in constant currency, driven by  the Xandr acquisition, and operating income decreased 15 percent and 9  percent in constant currency.  Now back to total company results.  Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.6 billion and cash  paid for P, P, and E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue  to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals.  Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5 percent year-over-year  driven by strong cloud billings and collections which were more than offset  by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed  in Q1 FY22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10 percent year-over-  year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations  grew 2 percent and free cash flow was relatively unchanged year-over-year.  This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million driven by interest  income which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on  foreign currency remeasurement.  Our effective tax rate was approximately 19 percent.  And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share  repurchases and dividends.  Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise,  is on a US dollar basis.  My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include  any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the  fiscal year.  First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now  expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and  to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3  points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 7 points of negative FX  impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points  in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing.  Our outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into  Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from  September will continue and impact both Windows OEM and Surface  device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you  heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their advertising spend  will impact LinkedIn and Search and news advertising revenue.  In our commercial business demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud  offerings together with consistent execution should drive healthy growth  across the Microsoft Cloud.  In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity  sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth  on a moderately growing expiry base, against a strong prior year  comparable which included a significant volume of large, long-term Azure  contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure  contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives  increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.  Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point  year-over-year driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted  earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease  roughly 2 points driven by lower Azure margin primarily due to higher  energy costs, revenue mix shift to Azure, and the impact from Nuance.  In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis  with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud  infrastructure buildout.  Next to segment guidance.  In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between  11 and 13 percent in constant currency or $16.6 to $16.9 billion US dollars.  In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365  with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We  expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant  currency basis. In our on-premises business we expect revenue to decline in  the low-to-mid 30s.  In Office consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits,  as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by  unfavorable FX impact.  For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform  although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and  hiring resulting in mid-to- high-single-digits revenue growth or low to mid-  teens growth in constant currency.  And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low-double-digits or the  low 20s in constant currency driven by continued share gains in Dynamics  365.  For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 22 and 24  percent in constant currency or $21.25 to $21.55 billion US dollars.  Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have  quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-  period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.  We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5  points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be  driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1  trends noted earlier. And our per-user business should continue to benefit  from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in  growth rates given the size of the installed base.  In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-  single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions including strong annuity  purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by  unfavorable FX impact.  And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-  single digits driven by Enterprise Support.  In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.5 to $14.9 billion  US dollars.  In Windows OEM we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding  the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would  decline mid-30s reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year  comparable, particularly in the commercial segment.  In Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30 percent, again roughly  in line with the PC market.  In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for  Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in  the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency.  Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow in the low-to-mid teens,  roughly 6 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue,  driven by growing first party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr.  And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid teens  against a strong prior year comparable that included several first-party title  launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers.

       "  'Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call  Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood  Tuesday, October 25, 2022  BRETT IVERSEN:  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are  Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief  financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver,  deputy general counsel.  On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings  press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to  supplement our prepared remarks during today\\'s call and provides the  reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial  measures.  On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial  measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior  to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with  GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in  further understanding the company\\'s first quarter performance in addition  to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.  All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the  corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also  provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework  for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the  effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the  same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.  We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following  the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\\'s call is being  webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our  live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.  You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor  Relations website.  During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are  predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These  statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are  subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ  because of factors discussed in today\\'s earnings press release, in the  comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of  our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to  update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Satya.  SATYA NADELLA:  Thank you, Brett.  To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these  changing economic times:  First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular  trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world\\'s GDP will  continue to increase.  Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of  their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.  And, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.  With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25  billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant  currency.  And, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader  commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this  fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our  consumer business.  With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.  Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less  today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk  around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.  We\\'re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with  infrastructure they already have.  With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services -  including containerized applications - across on-premises, edge, and multi-  cloud environments.  We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the  number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers\\' SAP  workloads in the cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo  Cars all run SAP on Azure.  We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle  databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for  companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both  companies.  And, with Azure Confidential Computing, we\\'re enabling companies in  highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive  applications to the cloud.  Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its  applications to Azure.  Now, to data and AI.  With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data  fabric, helping customers cut \"integration tax\" associated with bringing  together siloed solutions.  Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to  process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to  database powering the world\\'s most-demanding workloads, at limitless  scale.  Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud  provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and  NoSQL workloads.  And, in Al, we are turning the world\\'s most advanced models into platforms  for customers.  Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E to Azure OpenAI service,  helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation  model to commercial use cases for the first time.  And Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping  organizations like 3M deploy, manage, and govern models.  All-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four  quarters in a row.  Now, on to developers.  We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native  applications.  Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual  recurring revenue. And GitHub\\'s developer-first ethos has never been  stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software  for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times.  GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security  posture by bringing features directly into developers\\' workflows.  Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers  build and secure many of its most critical applications.  Now, on to Power Platform.  We\\'re helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite,  spanning low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual  agents, and business intelligence.  Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is  growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on  the tool for reporting and analytics.  Power Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly  15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a  year ago.  Power Automate has over 7 million monthly active users, and is being used  by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize  manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time.  And we\\'re going further, with new Al-powered capabilities in Power  Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.  Now, on to Dynamics 365.  From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we  continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example,  Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related  shipments.  CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost  efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency  and spend at its restaurants. And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and  improving supply chain visibility.  All-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business  applications.  Now, on to industry solutions.  We\\'re seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds.

       "  \"cial Services to deliver new  digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track  their environmental footprint.  New updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon  emissions.  And we're seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance  DAX ambient intelligence solution, which automatically documents patient  encounters at the point of care.  Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's  quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings.  Now, on to new systems of work.  Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in  today's digitally connected, distributed world of work.  Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people  work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT.  The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with  third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations.  Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become  essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate,  and do business.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we've gained and  are seeing increased engagement too.  Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.  In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams  chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more  features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year.  Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process.  Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications  within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year.  And, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today  also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.  Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by  double-digits for five quarters in a row.  We're bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including  Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively.  And we're creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help  organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person  work.  Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and  collaborate, Places will do the same for where.  We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for  advanced meeting features, like additional security options and intelligent  meeting recaps.  All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.  Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank,  continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security,  compliance, voice, and analytics.  We've also built a completely new suite with our employee experience  platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly  active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever.  And, we're extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping  salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time  by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into  their CRM system.  Now, on to Windows.  Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues  to see usage growth.  All-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active Windows devices  than pre-pandemic.  And, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5  percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.  And, we're seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11.  Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000  employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L'Oreal has  deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.  Now, on to security.  Security continues to be a top priority for every organization.  We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning  security, compliance, identity, and device management, and privacy across  all clouds and platforms.  More than 860,000 organizations across every industry - from BP and  Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies - now use our  security solutions, up 33 percent year over year.  They can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security  stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have  increased 50 percent year over year.  More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to  secure their entire digital estate.  The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44  percent year over year.  And as threats become more sophisticated, we're innovating to protect  customers.  New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and  manage security posture across clouds.  And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-  premises and cloud-based user directories.  Now, on to LinkedIn.  We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million  members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in  the Unites States.  There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on  LinkedIn, up 4X year over year.  New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning help companies  invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in  the flow of work.  Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months,  up 43 percent year over year.  And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn  professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform.  We launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping  sellers increase win rates and deal size by better understanding and  evaluating customer interest.  Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading  innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.  More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for  any marketer or advertiser looking to innovate.  We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X over the past year.  We're seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by  Windows.  Edge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain  share as people use built-in coupon and price comparison features to save  money.  We've surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we  brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets.  Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more  content, compared to a year ago.  And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory.  Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month,  exclusively powered by our technology and sales.  And, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel media platform for retailers  like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining  ownership of their own data and customer relationships.  Now, on to gaming.  We're adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition  to reach players wherever and whenever they want, on any device.  We saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by strength off-console.  PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year. And with  Cloud Gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played, and  viewed.  More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to  date.  And we're adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech  and Razer, as well as Meta Quest.  And, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming,  with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S.  Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.  In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the  ultimate tailwind.  And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every  organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence  and execution discipline.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.  AMY HOOD:  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter \",\n",

And that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest  here remain intact. And so, it's about both the optimization that you're  talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also  includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up,  one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some  volatility.  The other piece of it, Mark, that we didn't talk on before because I was  really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well,  right, because we're getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in  terms of the per-seat business.  So, there's a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a  very large base. It's not just the optimization to new workloads. It's also  some per-user work as well.  MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, last quarter you called out for the first time  SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning,  did that get worse this quarter? And did you see it filter now into the  enterprise? Can you talk about what you're seeing higher up above SMB?  AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about  Microsoft 365. I think that's a place where we can talk specifically about the  SMB market, because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it  was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4.  In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it  speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft. 365. We had on-  time renewals that were, frankly, better in Q1, based on expirations, than  we'd seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting  done on time but getting done within a discount range that we feel good  about, that's consistent. And we saw good upsell to E5. So if you think  about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB,  that's a good summary.  Where we in fact saw - I think we talked about it - new deal moderation, I'd  referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well, it tended to be in, to your point, the  smaller end of the market, small-to-midsize companies, and it also tended  to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit  and I'd refer to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some  new value that we've put into E3.  This is a place where there is some macro impact, but there's also, I think, a  better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition.  We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto  patching for Windows. It's a great value in the same way E5 is. We land the  E5 really well. We've got some work to do on landing E3.  So, there is some macro. It seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than  inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that I think,  frankly, we can get better at as well.  BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, Thank you very much. Satya, this  quarter, we're seeing an inflection in many of your Al breakthroughs. I'm  thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer  product. What is it that's enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially  to be first to market? I'm wondering if it's the OpenAl relationship or  maybe some of your inferencing capabilities, or something else.  And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in  Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of  dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like 200 million per  quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that  through this period?  SATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI  partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it's sort of important  to call out that we build the supercomputing capability inside of Azure,  which is highly differentiated the way compute and the network, in  particular, come along, come together in order to support these largescale  training of these platform models or foundation models has been very  critical. That's what's driven, in fact, the progress OpenAl has been making.  And of course, we then productize it as part of Azure OpenAI Services. And  that's what we're seeing both be used by our own first-party applications,  whether it's the GitHub Copilot or designer even inside Edge, and then of  course the third party, like Mattel.  And so, we're very excited about it. We have a lot, sort of more to talk  about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you'll see more advances  on GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area  of huge investment. The Al moment clearly has arrived and it's going to be  part of every product, whether it's - in fact, you mentioned our Power  Platform, because that's another area where we're innovating in terms of  incorporating all of these AI models.  Yeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability  at an infrastructure layer for training and inference. And the model  themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party applications  are getting better because of the use of those AI models.  AMY HOOD: And to your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a  little bit of help there. We did not see as big of that. As I said, it's over 800  for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2  through 4. And I think if you want to think about it as somewhere, 250-ish a  quarter. It's not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the  remainder of the year.  MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you.  BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please.  (Operator Direction.)  KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, I've love to just ask you around  margins. Clearly, you're experiencing a little bit more sales mix, given the  weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you've elected not to throttle  back OpEx to enable you to meet the three-months-ago guidance for flat  margins, so they'll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through  that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows  pressure?  AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl, and I shared a little bit on the call, but let me  share a little more because I think it's important in terms of how we think  about investment and continuing to invest where we're seeing substantial  opportunity and growth.  The PC market is cyclical, and we had some great benefits for a couple of  years during the pandemic. And we chose not to spend against that  favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line. And  you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did  that intentionally because it is a cyclical market.  And so, in the same way I see it now, is that PCs are going to be a tough  headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows app install base, our  ability to grow usage, it's still higher than it was. And that's a good  opportunity for us. And so, in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom  line when we saw a surge, it's important to stay consistent in this down  market, because when you have a type of opportunity that we have  specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked  about as being some of our most exciting, and you have the opportunity  with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it's  important to have a steady hand.  Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the  macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential  headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It'll be about investing \",\n",

       "  \"cial Services to deliver new  digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track  their environmental footprint.  New updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon  emissions.  And we're seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance  DAX ambient intelligence solution, which automatically documents patient  encounters at the point of care.  Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's  quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings.  Now, on to new systems of work.  Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in  today's digitally connected, distributed world of work.  Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people  work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT.  The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with  third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations.  Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become  essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate,  and do business.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we've gained and  are seeing increased engagement too.  Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.  In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams  chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more  features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year.  Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process.  Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications  within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year.  And, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today  also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.  Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by  double-digits for five quarters in a row.  We're bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including  Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively.  And we're creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help  organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person  work.  Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and  collaborate, Places will do the same for where.  We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for  advanced meeting features, like additional security options and intelligent  meeting recaps.  All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.  Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank,  continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security,  compliance, voice, and analytics.  We've also built a completely new suite with our employee experience  platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly  active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever.  And, we're extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping  salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time  by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into  their CRM system.  Now, on to Windows.  Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues  to see usage growth.  All-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active Windows devices  than pre-pandemic.  And, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5  percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.  And, we're seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11.  Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000  employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L'Oreal has  deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.  Now, on to security.  Security continues to be a top priority for every organization.  We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning  security, compliance, identity, and device management, and privacy across  all clouds and platforms.  More than 860,000 organizations across every industry - from BP and  Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies - now use our  security solutions, up 33 percent year over year.  They can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security  stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have  increased 50 percent year over year.  More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to  secure their entire digital estate.  The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44  percent year over year.  And as threats become more sophisticated, we're innovating to protect  customers.  New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and  manage security posture across clouds.  And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-  premises and cloud-based user directories.  Now, on to LinkedIn.  We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million  members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in  the Unites States.  There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on  LinkedIn, up 4X year over year.  New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning help companies  invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in  the flow of work.  Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months,  up 43 percent year over year.  And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn  professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform.  We launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping  sellers increase win rates and deal size by better understanding and  evaluating customer interest.  Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading  innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.  More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for  any marketer or advertiser looking to innovate.  We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X over the past year.  We're seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by  Windows.  Edge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain  share as people use built-in coupon and price comparison features to save  money.  We've surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we  brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets.  Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more  content, compared to a year ago.  And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory.  Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month,  exclusively powered by our technology and sales.  And, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel media platform for retailers  like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining  ownership of their own data and customer relationships.  Now, on to gaming.  We're adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition  to reach players wherever and whenever they want, on any device.  We saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by strength off-console.  PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year. And with  Cloud Gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played, and  viewed.  More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to  date.  And we're adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech  and Razer, as well as Meta Quest.  And, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming,  with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S.  Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.  In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the  ultimate tailwind.  And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every  organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence  and execution discipline.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.  AMY HOOD:  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter \",\n",

       "  'Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call  Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood  Tuesday, October 25, 2022  BRETT IVERSEN:  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are  Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief  financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver,  deputy general counsel.  On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings  press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to  supplement our prepared remarks during today\\'s call and provides the  reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial  measures.  On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial  measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior  to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with  GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in  further understanding the company\\'s first quarter performance in addition  to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.  All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the  corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also  provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework  for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the  effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the  same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.  We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following  the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\\'s call is being  webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our  live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.  You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor  Relations website.  During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are  predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These  statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are  subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ  because of factors discussed in today\\'s earnings press release, in the  comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of  our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to  update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Satya.  SATYA NADELLA:  Thank you, Brett.  To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these  changing economic times:  First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular  trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world\\'s GDP will  continue to increase.  Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of  their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.  And, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.  With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25  billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant  currency.  And, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader  commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this  fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our  consumer business.  With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.  Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less  today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk  around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.  We\\'re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with  infrastructure they already have.  With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services -  including containerized applications - across on-premises, edge, and multi-  cloud environments.  We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the  number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers\\' SAP  workloads in the cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo  Cars all run SAP on Azure.  We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle  databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for  companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both  companies.  And, with Azure Confidential Computing, we\\'re enabling companies in  highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive  applications to the cloud.  Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its  applications to Azure.  Now, to data and AI.  With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data  fabric, helping customers cut \"integration tax\" associated with bringing  together siloed solutions.  Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to  process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to  database powering the world\\'s most-demanding workloads, at limitless  scale.  Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud  provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and  NoSQL workloads.  And, in Al, we are turning the world\\'s most advanced models into platforms  for customers.  Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E to Azure OpenAI service,  helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation  model to commercial use cases for the first time.  And Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping  organizations like 3M deploy, manage, and govern models.  All-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four  quarters in a row.  Now, on to developers.  We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native  applications.  Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual  recurring revenue. And GitHub\\'s developer-first ethos has never been  stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software  for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times.  GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security  posture by bringing features directly into developers\\' workflows.  Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers  build and secure many of its most critical applications.  Now, on to Power Platform.  We\\'re helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite,  spanning low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual  agents, and business intelligence.  Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is  growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on  the tool for reporting and analytics.  Power Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly  15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a  year ago.  Power Automate has over 7 million monthly active users, and is being used  by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize  manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time.  And we\\'re going further, with new Al-powered capabilities in Power  Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.  Now, on to Dynamics 365.  From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we  continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example,  Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related  shipments.  CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost  efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency  and spend at its restaurants. And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and  improving supply chain visibility.  All-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business  applications.  Now, on to industry solutions.  We\\'re seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds.

      "cial Services to deliver new  digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track  their environmental footprint.  New updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon  emissions.  And we're seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance  DAX ambient intelligence solution, which automatically documents patient  encounters at the point of care.  Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's  quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings.  Now, on to new systems of work.  Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in  today's digitally connected, distributed world of work.  Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people  work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT.  The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with  third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations.  Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become  essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate,  and do business.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we've gained and  are seeing increased engagement too.  Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.  In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams  chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more  features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year.  Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process.  Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications  within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year.  And, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today  also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.  Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by  double-digits for five quarters in a row.  We're bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including  Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively.  And we're creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help  organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person  work.  Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and  collaborate, Places will do the same for where.  We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for  advanced meeting features, like additional security options and intelligent  meeting recaps.  All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.  Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank,  continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security,  compliance, voice, and analytics.  We've also built a completely new suite with our employee experience  platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly  active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever.  And, we're extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping  salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time  by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into  their CRM system.  Now, on to Windows.  Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues  to see usage growth.  All-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active Windows devices  than pre-pandemic.  And, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5  percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.  And, we're seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11.  Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000  employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L'Oreal has  deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.  Now, on to security.  Security continues to be a top priority for every organization.  We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning  security, compliance, identity, and device management, and privacy across  all clouds and platforms.  More than 860,000 organizations across every industry - from BP and  Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies - now use our  security solutions, up 33 percent year over year.  They can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security  stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have  increased 50 percent year over year.  More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to  secure their entire digital estate.  The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44  percent year over year.  And as threats become more sophisticated, we're innovating to protect  customers.  New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and  manage security posture across clouds.  And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-  premises and cloud-based user directories.  Now, on to LinkedIn.  We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million  members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in  the Unites States.  There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on  LinkedIn, up 4X year over year.  New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning help companies  invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in  the flow of work.  Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months,  up 43 percent year over year.  And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn  professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform.  We launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping  sellers increase win rates and deal size by better understanding and  evaluating customer interest.  Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading  innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.  More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for  any marketer or advertiser looking to innovate.  We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X over the past year.  We're seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by  Windows.  Edge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain  share as people use built-in coupon and price comparison features to save  money.  We've surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we  brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets.  Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more  content, compared to a year ago.  And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory.  Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month,  exclusively powered by our technology and sales.  And, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel media platform for retailers  like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining  ownership of their own data and customer relationships.  Now, on to gaming.  We're adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition  to reach players wherever and whenever they want, on any device.  We saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by strength off-console.  PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year. And with  Cloud Gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played, and  viewed.  More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to  date.  And we're adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech  and Razer, as well as Meta Quest.  And, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming,  with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S.  Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.  In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the  ultimate tailwind.  And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every  organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence  and execution discipline.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.  AMY HOOD:  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter \n",

      "Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call  Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood  Tuesday, October 25, 2022  BRETT IVERSEN:  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are  Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief  financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver,  deputy general counsel.  On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings  press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to  supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the  reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial  measures.  On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial  measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior  to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with  GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in  further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition  to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.  All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the  corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also  provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework  for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the  effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the  same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.  We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following  the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being  webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our  live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.  You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor  Relations website.  During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are  predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These  statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are  subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ  because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the  comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of  our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the  Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to  update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.  SATYA NADELLA:  Thank you, Brett.  To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these  changing economic times:  First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular  trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world's GDP will  continue to increase.  Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of  their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.  And, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.  With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25  billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant  currency.  And, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader  commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this  fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our  consumer business.  With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.  Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less  today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk  around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.  We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with  infrastructure they already have.  With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services -  including containerized applications - across on-premises, edge, and multi-  cloud environments.  We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the  number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP  workloads in the cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo  Cars all run SAP on Azure.  We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle  databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for  companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both  companies.  And, with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in  highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive  applications to the cloud.  Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its  applications to Azure.  Now, to data and AI.  With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data  fabric, helping customers cut \"integration tax\" associated with bringing  together siloed solutions.  Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to  process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to  database powering the world's most-demanding workloads, at limitless  scale.  Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud  provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and  NoSQL workloads.  And, in Al, we are turning the world's most advanced models into platforms  for customers.  Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E to Azure OpenAI service,  helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation  model to commercial use cases for the first time.  And Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping  organizations like 3M deploy, manage, and govern models.  All-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four  quarters in a row.  Now, on to developers.  We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native  applications.  Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual  recurring revenue. And GitHub's developer-first ethos has never been  stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software  for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times.  GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security  posture by bringing features directly into developers' workflows.  Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers  build and secure many of its most critical applications.  Now, on to Power Platform.  We're helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite,  spanning low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual  agents, and business intelligence.  Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is  growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on  the tool for reporting and analytics.  Power Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly  15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a  year ago.  Power Automate has over 7 million monthly active users, and is being used  by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize  manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time.  And we're going further, with new Al-powered capabilities in Power  Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.  Now, on to Dynamics 365.  From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we  continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example,  Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related  shipments.  CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost  efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency  and spend at its restaurants. And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and  improving supply chain visibility.  All-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business  applications.  Now, on to industry solutions.  We're seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds.  Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new  digital ex\n"
